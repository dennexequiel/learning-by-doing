## FRONTMATTER APP

This simple application lets you automate the creation of markdowns for static sites using a csv file. This app is dynamic so it will use the csv columns as key of the frontmatter.

## CONSTANTS

You need to replace the following in the code to fit your needs:
1. CSV_FILE_PATH = "media_pickups.csv"
2. OUTPUT_PATH = "markdowns"
3. FILE_NAME_COL_NAME = "file_name"
4. FRONT_MATTER_TYPE = "toml"
